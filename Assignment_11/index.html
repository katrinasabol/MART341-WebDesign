<p class="paragraph">

  Originally from Colorado, I found interest in the digital arts quickly. My parents gifted me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Video" target="_blank class="flipCam">Flip Video Camera</a> on my 10th birthday, and since then my art production has only increased.
<br/>
<br/>
  Through high school I took many film classes, but once I graduated and chose to continue my education at the University of Montana, I found that the Media Arts degree they offer fit me better than anything had before, allowing me to express myself without limitations, while also soon gaining a BA in Media Arts in December 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
  I've had lots of fun combining digital art and physical, like through screenprinting, and being able to implement my designs I make on my computer into editioned prints.
