    <h3>The Checkout Girl at Ross Called Me Cute </h3>
      <h5>By Jonathan Claveria</h5>

<p>  So I used literary criticism to understand why.</br>
  I began with a deconstruction of the construction of</br>
  our meeting, I was buying new boots, she was working her shift,</br>
  Then she said it, that I was ‘real cute’, but what does cute mean</br>
  in this context, its complex since cuteness tends to contrast,</br>
  It’s too vast, we know what cuteness is by what it is not,</br>
  which is a lot, like ugly or unattractive, but still so</br>
  abstractive, and if memory serves things like diction, language,</br>
  and words are interpretative with every thoughtful reading,</br>
  adding uncertainties when it’s certainty that I’m needing.</br>
  I thought hard, contemplated how attractive the both us are,</br>
  who is better looking, and if our own attractiveness</br>
  influences perception. Then I realized she is a</br>
  woman, not an object whose value's devalued, unvalued</br>
  by my shallow male standards. It is slander to consider</br>
  her any less than a feminist’s blessing, professing our</br>
  encounter as a denunciation of patriarchal notions,</br>
  her motions taking the lead, taking charge, expressing herself,</br>
  her feelings, and sexuality at large, juxtaposing my</br>
  impotence as I attempt to disprove, discharge her outward</br>
  confidence, her flattering words that make me feel insecure.</br>
  I thought of how I shop at Ross for discounted prices, she</br>
  works for discounted wages, meaning our meeting was tied to</br>
  class, status, the alienation from productions produced to</br>
  prolong problematic capitalistic endeavors, to</br>
  sever our worth, seizing the means in which we mean to seize, the</br>
  store, the job that robs her of her worth, her time, tick-tocking the</br>
  day away to where in years she’ll wonder why she went, wasted,</br>
  was hasted towards the holler of an almighty dollar,</br>
  until it starts, she feels the need, a call to action against</br>
  corporate greed. While all these concepts check out, makes sense, have post-</br>
  modern truth, none of them explain why she called me 'real cute'.</br></br></p>
