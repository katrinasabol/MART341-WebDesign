My user testing sessions went well. Most of where I found my issues were on my mobile version of the site, as some of the hover text would overflow, and hover features were not implicit unless you were on desktop. I also noted that with my home page, I need some content on it, and I got suggestions to make my About Me page the main one, and then make another page of a different kind of content. I also plan on making the menu bar on mobile a bit smaller, with the line spacing between the links shrinking, but keeping the vertical layout. I might consider adding titles to my art pieces
